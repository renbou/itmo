For each homework create "hwk-{x}" folder and replace {x} with number of homework or other id
In the folder create README.md where you should write info about who wrote the homework and what sources does it contain
All sources must be in the src folder (create it inside hwk-{x})
If your sources contain >1 file create a separate folder in the src folder
All pdfs must be compiled into the dist folder (create it inside hwk-{x}) and linked from the homework's readme
